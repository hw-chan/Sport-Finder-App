Note on Service Availability:
This application is hosted on Render using a free web service plan. Please be aware that if the service goes 15 minutes without receiving any traffic, it will be automatically "spun down" (temporarily stopped).When you visit the application after a period of inactivity, there might be a short delay as the service "spins up" (restarts) to handle your request. For example. when you first sign up/login, there may be a delay of 1-2 minutes.

## Reflection

This was a three-week-long project that I built in my free time. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.
